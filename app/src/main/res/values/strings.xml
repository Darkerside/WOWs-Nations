    <string name="us_desc">Ships fielded by the United States Navy (USN) sport great armor (albeit in an all-or-nothing design), main battery guns, and anti-aircraft (AA) capabilities, and are less hindered by stock configurations — many were built later and subsequently underwent fewer, less drastic upgrades (unlike Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) vessels such as Kongo). Most stock American ships are adequate for their roles, and while fully-upgraded ships perform better, they require little to no change in play style. American ship-launched torpedoes are often comically bad, but the real strength of USN ships lies in their ability to get into firefights and slug it out, relying on their superior guns and survivability to see them through. \n\n The United States inherited many of its nascent naval traditions from the British, from whom they won their independence in 1776. Over the years, the fledgling American navy encountered various hurdles and successes in its conflicts with the British, French, and Spanish navies. However, a mix of poor economic outlook, isolationist sentiments and post-World War I naval disarmament treaties reduced the effectiveness and preparedness of the USN for the Second World War. All of that changed after Japans 7 December 1941 surprise attack on Pacific Fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Regarded as an underhanded sneak attack outside the rules of civilized warfare, Pearl Harbor evaporated any reluctance of the American public to go to war. \n\n With its battleship fleet crippled by the Pearl Harbor attack, the USN turned to submarines and its fledgling aircraft carrier fleet — the very weapons that the IJN had used in their attempt to neutralize the USN Pacific Fleet — and ironically put them to greater effect than the Japanese (who stuck to battleships and the "decisive battle" doctrines), achieving successes in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. While slightly behind their IJN counterparts at the onset of the war, the USN gradually caught up both qualitatively and quantitatively; virtually every class of vessel was outfitted with superior fire control equipment such as radar and ballistics computers; the industrial might of the United States produced large numbers of proven designs (the 175 ships of the Fletcher class built within the space of less than four years being a prime example) with little unnecessary variation in equipment, so that crew transferred between ships could quickly fill their roles without specialized retraining. The US Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world, a title it still holds to this day.</string>

    <string name="us_infodd">The play style of American destroyers is best summarized as annoy and harrass their fast-firing guns in quick-turning turrets can continuously rain fire on opponents with impunity while under cover of smoke or vision blockers such as islands (or simply out of vision range). Tier X Gearing, the crown jewel of USN destroyers, can blanket her targets with more than 120 rounds per minute. Unfortunately, slow shell velocities and incredulously high shell arcs, while allowing captains to fire over islands, make it near-impossible to hit anything but the largest of targets beyond medium ranges. They also have reasonable anti-aircraft firepower, allowing them to play the role of escort ship when the need arises; fire discipline and astute Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) usage are required, since gun and anti-aircraft battery fire can broadcast a ship\'s position. American torpedoes had variable speed settings; in World of Warships, only the high-speed setting is available (with the exception of Tier VII premium Sims). In-game, this means that lower tier American destroyers, instead of stealthily launching a spread out of visual range, are forced to weather fire from their targets\' primary and secondary batteries well before they come within torpedo range. However, starting with Mahan at Tier VII, it is possible to launch a torpedo salvo from beyond detection range, albeit still at shorter ranges than their Japanese counterparts. To put things in perspective, Americans have to wait until their Tier IX\'s Fletcher before they get torpedoes with 10km range; the Japanese achieve this range with Tier VI destroyers Hatsuharu and Fubuki and both of them reload faster.</string>
    <string name="us_infoca">American cruisers are all about the guns; their primary battery, secondary battery, and anti-aircraft armament are superlative. Forgoing torpedoes after Omaha at Tier V, they are instead able to lay down an incredible hail of gunfire in almost any direction, due to the fast-firing guns located along the sides of their lower-tier ships, or in their fast-turning turrets at higher tiers. Any enemies — especially destroyers — that come within firing range and do not take evasive action are quickly sent to the bottom of the ocean, particularly after the line gains access to the Surveillance Radar (While active, detects all enemy ships within the specified radius, disregarding obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable at Tier VIII. Although the Japanese often have better range and firepower, the Americans have faster turret traverse, conventional layouts, and higher rates of fire; the high shell arc of some of their cruiser rifles — like their destroyer counterparts — is a double-edged sword, with a plunging trajectory hampered by their unimpressive shell velocities. Their anti-aircraft batteries easily dissuade aircraft from venturing too close or even approaching if they\'re not massed together for protection; yet even then, a well-timed Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) will quickly deplete the assets of enemy aircraft carriers. The American cruiser line splits after Omaha into a heavy cruiser branch - starting with Pensacola and topped by Des Moines - and a light cruiser branch starting with Dallas and topped by Worcester. Des Moines is the very pinnacle of the all-gun cruiser, as she has a very powerful anti-aircraft suite and main batteries that have unrivaled rate of fire. Worcester has rapid-fire guns, many consumables, and a great AA suite, which gives her unparalleled versatility on the battlefield.</string>
    <string name="us_infobb">American battleships follow more orthodox and consistent designs: while their guns may not be as large and powerful as those of the IJN, the USN ships make up for it by having more guns that fire more often, giving them unmatched broadside firepower. Their anti-air suites are also fairly decent at staving off aerial assaults, although it\'s still recommended to have cruiser escort. In spite of inferior firing ranges and poor mobility, American battleships are capable of absorbing major damage in order to bring their guns to bear—their citadel armor is impenetrable to all but the largest caliber shells (at the cost of having a more lightly-armored bow and stern). Moving up the tech tree, their mobility progressively improves and catches up with the Japanese with the North Carolina at Tier VIII, and their AA firepower grows to the point that they either become practically immune to all but the most concentrated of air attacks, or the aircraft will not survive the return trip. From Tier III to IX, American battleships enjoy a better repair party consumable than other nations, excluding the british, giving the line better durability. The Tier X Montana is the pinnacle of the American battleship line: the evolution of the Iowa-class battleship design whose construction was cancelled some time after receiving congressional approval for construction in order to focus more on aircraft carrier production.</string>
    <string name="us_infocv">Early in the war, the overall state and quantity of USN naval aviation lagged behind their Japanese rivals. Thus, their early carriers can be painful to use. Their large sizes up-and-down the line mean that they can be seen from miles away (Tier X carrier Midway has one of the worst concealment values in the game, even worse than Yamato), and even though they are quite durable with surprisingly strong anti-aircraft defenses, remaining un-spotted or sticking with teammates for protection is still recommended. All American carriers carry HE bombers with the exception of Tier VIII premium Enterprise. The HE bombs are a devastating threat to destroyers and a nuisance to other ship types. Planes have high health pool compared to their IJN counterparts, allowing them to survive longer and keep full squadrons toward the end of the game. However, torpedo bombers carry very slow torpedoes with short range and a large dispersion even when fully aimed. Players are encouraged to drop their payload at close distances. From Tier VIII and above, American attack planes can equip Tiny Tim rockets that can devastate all ship types with a single run.</string>
    <string name="jpn_desc">As an island nation, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was consistently the forefront of Japan\'s military, characterized by advanced development of naval technology, quality shipbuilding and superb seamanship. Japan also readily looked to and accepted foreign input after the opening of their borders, from the rapid assimilation of foreign technology, to the frequent military exchanges with Dutch, French, British and United States navies, with plenty of naval students being sent to their naval academies and many ships (such as the Kongo) initially being purchased or built in their dockyards while Japan perfected her own shipbuilding capabilities. At the onset of World War II, the IJN was among the few navies who had properly adopted naval aviation and the only navy with fully developed torpedo assets, achieving stunning victories and technological innovations — sweeping successes in the Russo\-Japanese and First Sino\-Japanese Wars, the Battle of Tsushima, the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, the world\'s first purpose\-built aircraft carrier, the deadly Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo — and laying down classes of cruisers and destroyers that, despite being much older than their adversaries, remained among the most powerful of their class of any nation during the War.\nHowever, several mistakes and oversights during the war resulted in their near\-annihilation by the United States Navy. Design flaws — typically the results of cramming as much weaponry as possible into a limited displacement — caused certain ships to be top\-heavy and unstable. While concentrating air assets into a single, cohesive force was as effective as it was revolutionary, their carriers were inadequately protected from counterattacks due to lack of radar, faulty design and configuration of anti\-aircraft guns, as well as ineffective fire control systems. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii of 7 December 1941 was a tactical victory but a strategic error, bringing into the war a nation that — while initially under\-prepared and as yet unwilling to go to war — had near\-limitless resources and unmatched production capabilities. Compounding the error, little to none of the support facilities based in Pearl Harbor — naval repair yards, fuel depots, logistics infrastructure — were attacked, allowing the United States to quickly recover and strike back with a vengeance from their primary naval base in the Pacific. In contrast, Japan did not have the capabilities to replace their losses as quickly, were incredibly dependent on imports — indeed, reducing that dependency was actually one of the major reasons for Japan\'s expansionist desires — and their unprotected shipping lines due to under\-investment in anti\-submarine and anti\-aircraft warfare allowed the United States Navy to slowly starve Japan into submission.\nJapanese ships tend to have great variations in design; each class encountered is likely to have noticeably different handling characteristics from the previous tier, a result of the IJN constantly experimenting with or influenced by different designs and doctrines. They boast consistently superior torpedoes, accurate and long\-range guns with high alpha damage, and outstanding concealment and mobility; however, they suffer from inferior survivability and anti\-aircraft defenses. Their play style is very similar to the "decisive battle" doctrine that dominated IJN tactics: strike fast and strike hard with precision at targets of importance and/or opportunity, but every hit taken in exchange will be painfully felt.</string>

    <string name="jpn_infodd">Japanese destroyers rely on remaining unspotted and depend heavily on making good use of their torpedoes; the tech tree splits at Tier V after Isokaze, with one line focusing on torpedoes and the other on gunnery.\nThe torpedo\-centric line tends to have weak, slow\-turning main battery guns that are generally not worth firing unless they happen to be pointing in the enemy\'s direction. Even then, it is frequently better to hold fire to maintain concealment. Concealment issues are exacerbated with the Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line\-of\-sight for both enemies and teammates.) on Japanese destroyers having fewer charges and shorter durations, giving captains less flexibility to get out of sticky situations. Fortunately, from Tier IX, their concealment values are above average; Tier X\'s Shimakaze has the best concealment value at her tier. Their torpedoes are unmatched at every tier, having the highest damage and longest ranges of any vessel that can equip torpedoes. This allows them to snipe enemy warships while well out of visual range. Starting with Yūgumo at Tier IX, their guns begin to be more effective and captains get to choose from three types of torpedoes: high\-speed (up to an incredible 76 knots) but shorter range and mediocre detection range; very long range but low speed ("low" being something of a misnomer, given that they still move at more than 60 knots) and bad detection range; and an in\-between option that has average speed coupled with better detection (though still more easily spotted than other nation\'s) and range. This allows for variable play styles and keeps opponents guessing. Combined with the Torpedo Acceleration skill the short\-range torpedoes can be particularly vicious; it is almost impossible for enemy captains to dodge torpedoes streaking in at a whopping 81 knots. However, while these torpedoes have a long range and are fast, they also have the worst detectability out of all the nations.\nThe gunnery\-focused line does not mean that they become pseudo\-American destroyers, but many of the quirks of the torpedo\-focused destroyers are addressed to a certain degree, increasing the all\-round capabilities of the ships while still keeping the distinctive characteristics of Japanese destroyers. However, all these improvements are implemented in an arduously gradual process — captains will only start seeing real differences once they reach Shiratsuyu and Akizuki at Tiers VII and VIII, respectively. Their turret\-turning speeds are improved, their guns fire faster and further (shell damage and velocities are largely the same) and they have better anti\-aircraft suites. Amazingly, until Tier VIII their concealment values are better than that of the torpedo\-focused line, and both lines have access to the same models of torpedoes. What\'s more, the gunnery\-focused line gets a better version of the Torpedo Reload Booster (When used, torpedo reload time is significantly reduced.) consumable! As an added bonus, starting from Akizuki, the destroyers mount the Japanese 100mm guns with increased HE shell penetration allowing them to penetrate 25mm armor plating naturally. When paired with the Inertia Fuse for HE Shells commander skill, these guns can penetrate up to 32mm of armor, allowing them to penetrate the bow armor and plating of most high\-tier battleships and cruisers. Tier X\'s Harugumo is the epitome of the IJN gunboat destroyer, spraying copious quantities of shells in all directions. Unfortunately, these ships are equipped with fewer torpedo launchers with longer default reload times, and their mobility is among the worst for destroyers, with inferior speed, maneuverability, and underwhelming acceleration. Further compounding the maneuverability issues are their massive size and larger\-than\-average detection range from Tier VIII onwards. With all of these quirks, the gunnery\-focused destroyers are essentially pseudo\-light cruisers.</string>
    <string name="jpn_infoca">Japanese cruisers tend to have fewer guns housed in slow\-turning turrets, coupled with excellent maneuverability and concealment values, and virtually all of them are equipped with a complement of torpedoes that are on par with their destroyer cousins \- at the higher tiers, these torpedo tubes will often be located aft of the vessel hampering firing arcs. As such, do not be fooled if a Japanese cruiser starts turning away mid\-fight; they may have very likely just launched a spread of torpedoes in your direction. From Tier V\'s Furutaka onwards, they are equipped with accurate, powerful guns that, while lacking in rate of fire, have reasonable shell arcs and velocity and are able to reliably penetrate or set their enemies on fire; their high explosive shells have some of the highest chances among all cruisers in World of Warships to set targets on fire. Their anti\-aircraft suites are sufficient for self\-defense, but captains will be hard\-pressed to protect their teammates. Tier X\'s Zao is considered the very pinnacle of what Japanese cruiser design: difficult to detect, she strikes first and hard. She is capable of giving enemy ships a nasty surprise when they are at close range and is a highly effective surface combatant in all situations.</string>
    <string name="jpn_infobb">Japanese battleships were somewhat restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty, forcing them to resort to unusual — but often innovative — designs in outfitting their battleships. This resulted in battleships that have widely varying characteristics: the ponderous and slow Kawachi; the fast and agile Kongo; and the well\-balanced Nagato; culminating in the crown of their battleship tree, the formidable Yamato. Japanese battleships often have the highest caliber guns with the longest ranges of their tier, which they can extend even further still with Spotting Aircraft, allowing them to rain destruction upon their enemies with impunity. Many of them have good speeds and agility that belies their size and class, but their armor protection frequently lags behind their counterparts of other nations \- it tends to be more evenly spread out around the entire ship, so while their citadels may not be as well\-protected, at least until Yamato, they have few obvious weak spots. Like their cruiser cousins, their anti\-aircraft firepower is sufficient for self\-defense, but captains will want cruiser support to ward off more concentrated aerial assaults.</string>
    <string name="jpn_infocv">Japanese aircraft carriers have good maneuverability and concealment values, allowing them to re-position and evade enemies exceptionally well. With the exception of the Tier VIII premium Kaga, IJN carriers have AP bombers instead of HE. This limits their anti-destroyer role as a carrier but highly effective against German, French and Soviet battleships. Torpedo squadrons carry the best air-bourne torpedoes in the game which allow players to drop their load at safer distances from anti-air. Japanese carriers also have planes with the lowest health pools resulting in lower survivability when engaging ships with high anti-air capabilities. Poor or reckless endangerment of their squadrons will end up in the carrier running out of aircraft and thus being of limited use to the team. Hakuryu — or G15 Taiho Mod. 2 in official designation — currently represents the pinnacle of what IJN carriers might have achieved, as it can theoretically destroy even the toughest battleships with sheer squadron numbers alone.</string>
    <string name="ussr_desc">With over half her massive landmass bordered by water, Russia\'s navy was (and still is today) divided into four major fleets\: the Pacific, Northern, Baltic and Black Sea Fleets; at the height of the Russian Empire, the Imperial Russian Navy was the fourth most powerful fleet in the world after Great Britain, Spain and France. Lagging technological advancement and disastrous wars greatly dented her power, resulting in mixed performance in World War I; the Northern Fleet was created during the War to protect shipping in the Barents Sea, the Baltic Fleet played a largely defensive role, the Black Sea Fleet distinguished herself against the Ottoman Navy and the Pacific Fleet had faded into insignificance following the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The Imperial Russian Navy suffered a near-complete collapse in the Russian Revolution and the resulting Civil War during the closing years of World War I, and was eventually succeeded by the Soviet Union\'s Red Fleet.\nIn the years between the World Wars, the rapidly-industrializing Soviet Union (or U.S.S.R.) planned to rebuild the navy, but the Great Purge prevented any meaningful progress, and the Red Fleet would only have a handful of cruisers, obsolete battleships and a reasonable number of destroyers when the U.S.S.R. entered World War II in June 1942 with Germany\'s invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. However, this did not stop the Red Fleet from performing with distinction: the Baltic Fleet used its sizable submarine fleet to great effect against the Kriegsmarine and the Finnish Navy despite suffering terrible losses themselves; the Naval Aviation service, while not having a single aircraft carrier, sank more ships and crew than any other unit; Russian resourcefulness and tenacity was exemplified by naval guns still being put to use even after extensive damage to individual ships (such as battleship Marat). Thousands of sailors and naval equipment were drafted to reinforce the Red Army as needed, fighting with incredible valor in many significant engagements, including the Battles of Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Leningrad. After World War II, the Red Fleet was renamed the Soviet Navy, and went on to play a major role in the Cold War with the United States.</string>

    <string name="ussr_infodd">Russian destroyers are an oddity; they frequently feel as if they have the powerful, fast&#8211;firing guns of their American counterparts mounted in the arduously slow&#8211;turning turrets of the Japanese destroyer line. However, that is where the similarities end; Russian destroyers excel at long&#8211; to mid&#8211;range gunnery where they can keep their enemies at an arms\' length. Their guns often fire out at similar or longer ranges than their American counterparts, but have flatter firing arcs and faster shell velocities, allowing them to snipe distant targets and even citadel lightly armored cruisers (since players can reliably fire at their broadsides at medium ranges, something that American destroyers struggle with). Most of the ships in this class will reach speeds of up to 43 knots, making many of them the fastest ships in their tiers, but their maneuverability and concealment values are lackluster in comparison. Coupled with their slow turret turning speeds, Russian destroyers will struggle against the American destroyers in a close&#8211;range gunnery knife fight. Their torpedoes also leave much to be desired; the miserable effective range of 4.0 km persists until Tier VIII, and they will never exceed 10.0 km range even at top&#8211;tier; on the bright side, with fast speeds of 65&#8211;70 knots and a good number of 9 or 10 torpedo tubes on most destroyers, audacious captains can pull off spectacular ambushes or shotgun engagements (just don\'t forget about the minimum arming distance).</string>
    <string name="ussr_infoca">Russian cruisers are similar to their American and German counterparts focusing on gunnery but are more or less the eponymous \"jack of all trades\" cruisers. From from Tier VI onwards, they mount largely 6inch (152mm) guns that behave much like the fast&#8211;firing guns of the American light cruiser branch, but they have more of the Kriegsmarine\'s flat firing arcs and high shell velocities. Overall their anti&#8211;aircraft armament is middle&#8211;of&#8211;the road, and sufficient primarily for self&#8211;defense (with a few notable exceptions such as Tier VIII premium Mikhail Kutuzov). The turning radii and rudder shift of the entire line leaves much to be desired, but they do have excellent speed. With this deadly combination of speed and quick&#8211;firing, highly accurate guns, they can repeatedly pound enemies at long ranges with impunity while having the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions on the battlefield when required. However, they are generally among the largest cruisers in the game, with proportionately large citadels and lousy concealment values as a result (the Tier X Moskva being nearly the size of Yamato). They typically have rather thin armor that sometimes even destroyer guns can put a round into and penetrate. Their torpedoes are as pitiful as their destroyer counterparts, with only Dmitri Donskoi at Tier IX having a reasonable range of 8km and the rest of the line stuck at 4&#8211;5 km, despite sharing the same 65&#8211;111knot speeds.</string>
    <string name="ussr_infobb">Russian battleships are most effective at mid to close range fights as their guns become inaccurate beyond 12kms. As designed to push flanks or enemy lines, the entire line boasts good health pool and turret traverse. From Tier IX and onwards, they enjoy thickly armored decks that make most HE shells shatter. They have one of the fastest traverse speed compared to the same gun caliber, making brawling easier and saving points that would\'ve gone into Expert Marksman. The guns of this line are atypical as they get accurate at close~12km ranges but become inaccurate when shotting anything further than that, almost comparable to German battleships. Overall, the ships of this line have high citadel, making angling imperative in battleship duels. Handling of these ships may be cumbersome as they are long and from Tier VII and above, they have a huge turning radius. However, they have very good rudder-shift time that will help you avoid many obstacles if driven wisely. Russian battleships have a very peculiar consumable as they are equipped with limited Damage Control Party but with a shorter cooldown. This will help you tank more damage and survive under heavy fire. </string>

    <string name="grm_desc">Throughout most of European history, Germany"'"s naval prowess had always been eclipsed by its British, French, Dutch and Spanish neighbors. A unified Germany only came into being in the late 19th century, thus it did not play a major role in the European colonial period; while its inherited coastline (largely from the Kingdom of Prussia) was relatively long, Germany"'"s geographical location at the center of the European continent meant that greater preference was given to its army and its navy never went beyond being a coastal defense force. Beginning in the late 19th century, Kaiser Wilhelm II pursued a policy of naval strengthening, believing that a powerful navy was the key to power on the world stage and possibly also wishing to compete with his cousin, King George V of Britain. While the meteoric rise of the Imperial German Navy caught the attention of Europe and brought about a costly naval arms race, it was never able to out-build and out-innovate the Royal Navy, who responded with powerful and revolutionary designs such as HMS Dreadnought and the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships. Nevertheless, the Imperial German Navy was a formidable force in World War I, being the first navy in the world to display the crippling effectiveness of submarines (despite technological limitations) against unescorted merchant shipping and slow, sluggish warships.\nAfter her defeat, Germany once again set about attempting to challenge the Royal Navy with "Plan Z", but the earlier-than-expected outbreak of World War II meant that it could not be fully implemented, leaving her navy — now known as the Kriegsmarine — severely under-equipped to go toe-to-toe with the Royal Navy. This caused her surface fleet to be mostly relegated to operations support (such as Operation Weserübung, the invasion of Norway and Denmark) and commerce raiding. However, the Kriegsmarine had powerful (but very few) battleships and battlecruisers, scoring victories in sinking HMS Hood and HMS Glorious and putting up valiant, stubborn resistance — a testament to the crews"'" tenacity — until the superior numbers of British forces wore them down. As in World War I, more feared than her surface combatants were her fleet of U-boats; the largest, most powerful in the world and under the command of Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz — an experienced submariner himself who was instrumental in the buildup of the U-boat fleet after the scrapping of "Plan Z" — they wreaked havoc on British and American fleets and supply lines, sinking 14 million tons of shipping and more enemy warships than any other class throughout the war. Eventually, mounting losses inflicted by the Royal Navy resulted in the Kriegsmarine"'"s surrender along with Germany on 8 May 1945, Victory in Europe (V-E) Day.</string>

    <string name="grm_infodd">German destroyers offer a mix in playstyles. A captain who enjoys Russian destroyers will enjoy the primary gun handling. Fans of Japanese destroyers will enjoy their fast-reloading torpedoes. And American destroyer captains will find themselves in one of the best capture point destroyers available. The early tiers encourage aggressive play with forward-firing torpedo arcs all the way to Tier IV. Charge an enemy battleship with Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship\'s speed by a fixed percentage.), change course to fire both front torpedoes, close to point-blank range, turn and unload. Unlike American destroyers, German Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) consumables do not last as long, so they are mainly used as a defensive measure. The Tier V T-22 loses the forward-facing torpedo arcs and serves as a transition from the low tier destroyers to the high tier. Things get interesting at Tier VI with the Ernst Gaede, as it adds one more tool to the German captain\'s arsenal: Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.). Now the hunted becomes the hunter, as German Destroyers from Tier VI and above are able to charge an enemy smoke cloud, activate Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.), and spot incoming torpedoes and the enemy ship itself. Enemy destroyers are no longer safe remaining in their smoke cloud on a capture point. Kill them or drive them off and capture the point! Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) also enables German destroyers to screen ahead of the fleet and locate incoming torpedoes aimed at friendly battleships. To mix things up, both the Tier VI Ernst Gaede and the Tier VIII Z-23 allow for 150mm guns. These guns, coupled with strong armor-piercing shells, enable the experienced German captain to citadel broadside cruisers. This destroyer line does have some drawbacks, however. These ships can be vulnerable to enemy aircraft spotting or attacking them. In addition, their wide hull makes it very easy for enemy cruisers and battleships to penetrate with armor-piercing shells, doing more damage than expected. A German destroyer captain must keep these weaknesses in mind when operating in a battle. Teamwork is of the utmost importance!</string>
    <string name="grm_infoca">German cruisers start off as lighter versions of their contemporaries, but as they progress up the tiers (especially past Tier VI), their true prowess is revealed: turrets that turn lightning-fast, housing guns that rapidly fire powerful armor-piercing shells at long ranges, outranging both American and Japanese cruisers and even some battleships. Moreover, they commonly have the highest health values of their tier — allowing them to take a beating before going down — and their shells have reasonable firing arcs (i.e. no rainbow-like arcs such as those found on American destroyers and light cruisers) making gunnery very comfortable. Interestingly, their torpedoes from Tier V onwards are all exactly the same; do not underestimate them, however, for while a 6.0 km range is only marginally better than mid-tier American destroyers, at 64 knots German cruiser torpedoes are the fastest torpedoes mounted by any cruiser in the game until Tier IX Japanese cruiser Ibuki gets her upgraded torpedo module. Mid-tier German cruisers have mediocre anti-aircraft suites at best, but at Tier VIII and above they are loaded with a mix of long-range, high damage 40mm, 55mm, and 105mm guns that provide excellent AA protection for themselves and allied ships — particularly with the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable — and are frequently a source of frustration for enemy carrier captains. The downside is that German cruisers overall suffer from below average to average armor, poor concealment values, sub-par HE shell damage, and rather average speed and maneuverability. Starting at Tier IV, German cruisers have access to a superior version of the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable.</string>
    <string name="grm_infobb">German battleships exemplify their focus on designs and armor schemes capable of absorbing extraordinary amounts punishment and still remain afloat. Their main armament is often slightly smaller than their same-tier counterparts — though they reload quicker — and they frequently have more hit points and better armor, making them some of the most survivable battleships in the game. Their historical "turtleback" armor is modeled accurately in-game; they are more resilient the closer in they get to their enemies, though their armor schemes do leave them more vulnerable to long-range plunging fire. These battleships feature heavy secondary armaments up-and-down the line, further rewarding players who are able to work into close-range brawls with enemy capital ships. Like their cruiser comrades, mid-to-high tier German battleships typically feature excellent long-range anti-aircraft firepower on the backs of their 105mm dual purpose batteries, but their AA doesn\'t continue to scale up the closer enemy planes get like American battleship anti-aircraft firepower does. Though they feature quicker-than-average rudder shift times, they tend to have very large turning circles that make avoiding both ship and aerial torpedoes difficult. German battleships at Tier VIII and up receive access to the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable to help alleviate this, but it is a constant threat that captains must keep in mind.</string>

    <string name="uk_desc">From the early 18th century until the middle of the 20th century, the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom was the most powerful in the world, defeating the French, Dutch and Spanish navies to establish the British Empire as the dominant world power — the "empire on which the sun never sets" — influencing many aspects of life in numerous countries across the world, even today. Due to this historical prominence, although many other navies have similar designations, only the United Kingdom\'s is referred to as "The Royal Navy" without further qualification. The Royal Navy pioneered many advances in naval technology and strategy: the construction of HMS Dreadnought, whose revolutionary design so shocked the world that battleships for a time became generically labelled as "dreadnought" or "pre\-dreadnought"; the first battlecruisers; the world\'s first carrier\-launched, all\-aircraft attack at the Battle of Taranto; anti\-submarine warfare advancements such as sonar, high\-frequency direction finding, hydrophones, depth charges, and the "Hedgehog" anti\-submarine mortar; and innovations to aircraft carrier designs such as concentrating the bridge and flight control tower into one island superstructure (as opposed to a flush deck configuration), steam catapults and ski\-jump ramps for launching aircraft, and full\-length, armored, and angled flight decks. Up to and during the First World War, the Germans attempted to challenge the might of the Royal Navy, only to be blockaded and stymied by the latter\'s superior tactics (drawn from centuries of experience) and numbers; however, the effectiveness of Germany\'s U\-boats on unescorted shipping taught the British important lessons in convoy tactics \- a lesson which the Americans would soon learn upon their entry into the Second World War. Although World War I severely depleted the British and consequently the Royal Navy, it was still a formidable force, and after the London and Washington Naval Treaties were no longer being observed by the other nations in 1938, it set about rapidly re\-arming itself to reaffirm its place as the most powerful navy in the world. This did not come by easily however, as it suffered heavy losses in the opening stages of World War II with the sinking of HMS Courageous, HMS Glorious, and HMS Hood in the Atlantic, and HMS Hermes, HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales in the Pacific. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy\'s resilience won through, playing a major part in Operations Dynamo, Husky, Torch, Avalanche, and Overlord; the guarding of supply lines that enabled the British and her allies to fight in all theaters of the War; the British Pacific Fleet distinguished herself in every engagement she was involved in, despite facing various logistical and political difficulties; the systematic cornering and sinking of the Kriegsmarine\'s powerful battleships and battlecruisers; the seizing of many Enigma\-related codebooks and machines; and the near\-annihilation of the U\-boat fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic. Both World Wars greatly taxed the British Empire, and her decline led to the Royal Navy handing the reins over to the US Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.</string>

    <string name="uk_infoca">British cruisers in World of Warships share many similarities with American and German cruisers, with fast\-firing guns housed in quick\-turning turrets; however, they fire only armor\-piercing rounds. While the lack of high\-explosive shells greatly reduces their versatility against more heavily armored ships or well\-angled opponents, their AP shells\' fuse lengths and penetration values are improved over other nations\' such that shots are able to penetrate in places where they would normally bounce off. In addition, they do not have another mainstay of cruisers: the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti\-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable. This means that Royal Navy cruisers have to brute force their way through aircraft attacks, which isn\'t as bad as it sounds given that their AA firepower can be on par with American cruisers (and eventually exceeds them with Neptune and Minotaur). Their armor is quite thin with rather large citadels, although like American cruisers, this weakness is partially offset by their citadels being mostly below the waterline, with exposed parts reinforced with additional armor. However, this is where the bad news ends; while having average rudder shift timings, British cruisers have extremely good acceleration values (and good top speeds) that allow them to maintain near\-maximum speeds even while doing sharp turns; their concealment values are among the best for cruisers of all nations; they have additional access to other consumables like Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship\'s hit points each second.), Surveillance Radar (While active, detects all enemy ships within the specified radius, disregarding obstacles such as smoke and terrain.), and Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line\-of\-sight for both enemies and teammates.) that most other cruisers can only dream of having, giving them unparalleled utility. Their torpedo armament is sufficient for the most part — having decent ranges with 60\-knot speeds – and instead of choosing between wide and narrow spreads, captains can choose to fire off individual torpedoes or expend the entire launcher at once. Skilled captains will use these cruisers\' agility and tools to get themselves into advantageous positions or out of sticky situations and dictate engagements on their own terms. </string>
    <string name="uk_infobb">British battleships rule the seas with grace and exemplary combat ability. These formidable ships are a serious threat to ships from every nation. At low tiers, these battleships are well\-armored, making them very hard to kill with smaller caliber guns. However, they can be susceptible to large caliber AP shells. Players in British battleships should make an attempt to avoid close\-range gunfights with other battleships. Excelling in medium to long range combat, these ships can burn their enemies to the waterline before they have a chance to close the range. British battleships fire some of the best high explosive shells in the game. They have a very high fire chance, which means that many salvoes will result in fires started on the decks of enemy ships. However, their withering firepower isn\'t limited to HE shells. If an enemy ship is foolish enough to show her broadside, British AP rounds can be a quick ticket to port. Luckily, these ships aren\'t limited to just gunfighting. As players progress through the line, they will find the power of the anti aircraft armament to increase with each new ship they unlock. When fully specialized for AA in higher tiers, airspace above these battleships is a no\-fly zone. Another perk of Tier IX\'s Lion and Tier X\'s Conqueror is an extraordinary version of the Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship\'s hit points each second.) consumable that makes up for their lower health pools pool compared to similar tier battleships. In certain situations, this repair is capable of restoring nearly half of the ship\'s total hit points. All of this means that these battleships are truly survivors who fight to their last hit point.</string>
    <string name="uk_infocv">British carriers were intoduced in update 0.8.2. Unlike other carrier lines of the Americans or Japanese, British carriers have HE bombers with the \'carpet bombing\' feature. These are not your typical dive bombers as the planes fly horizontally over the target dropping several small bombs in the targeted area. As the bombs take time to fall, players have to time their drops wisely, taking the momentum of the target into account. British torpedo bombers are the easiest to use of all three nations. Although the damage per torpedo, speed and range are lacking; the torpedo bombers themselves have a tight turning circle and aiming guide. Multiple hits on the target will compensate for its somewhat poor stats. Attack aircraft is also something not to ignore, as they drop their payload faster than the two nations. They also arm faster, making easier for players to hit unplanned targets.</string>
    <string name="cmw_desc">The "Commonwealth of Nations" was born in the early twentieth century during the waning years of the British Empire. Officially formed in December 1931 via the Statute of Westminster, the original seven member states were the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Today, it is made up of 52 sovereign states that span the globe, and currently includes nations that had no previous political or economic ties to the United Kingdom or the British Empire. Several of the various nation\-states that comprise the Commonwealth deploy their own military forces. Collectively, they are represented in World of Warships under a single flag, but each navy has its own history and traditions.</string>

    <string name="cmw_infodd">At the beginning of the twentieth century, the British Empire faced a unique dilemma: the challenge of protecting its many dominions across the world. In the case of the Dominion of Canada, there were two easy solutions: either provide the Royal Navy the resources to protects borders of the Dominion, or take the necessary steps to allow Canada to provide for her own defense. The latter path was chosen, and soon the government put forth a Naval Service Bill organizing a permanent and volunteer force, as well founding as a naval college to train future personnel. Thus, in 1910 the Naval Service of Canada was born; it was later designated the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) by King George V on 29 August 1911. The nucleus of the nascent navy came in the shape of two cruisers: HMCS Rainbow and HMCS Niobe, both seeing service primarily as training vessels. Despite government contention on the logistics and practicality of fielding a navy, the citizens of Canada were supportive of the institution and bolstered the manpower of the volunteer reserve forces (RNCVR). By the start of the First World War, the RCN had grown to four cruisers and two submarines. This rather small force spent the majority of the conflict patrolling both coastlines of North America, with most of these assets being deemed unfit for service before the war’s end. The lack of growth of the Navy was largely attributed to the decision by the Canadian government to allow citizens to choose whether they wished to serve with the Royal Canadian Navy or the British equivalent; many chose to serve in the latter. The end of World War I saw a reduction of manpower plus a transition to conducting civilian duties, with its handful of destroyers and single cruiser. On the other hand, enthusiasm in the RNCVR stayed strong and continued to grow through the interwar years. By the 1930\'s, the RCN was slowly seeing new life breathed into it via the acquisition of two new destroyers built in England – the first ships purpose\-built for the RCN. Further investment in the service was spurred on by rising tensions and aggression in Europe and Asia; more destroyers and training vessels were acquired. The events of the Second World War saw an explosion of growth for the Royal Canadian Navy; ships were simultaneously produced at home and acquired from abroad, with new recruits drawing in from all across the country. The Navy primarily operated in the North Atlantic and was solely responsible for the oversight of the entire Northwest Theater of operations. The RCN fulfilled two primary functions: convoy protection and submarine hunting. During six years of active combat duty, the RCN proved its potential through the destruction or capture of twenty\-seven (27) German submarines and forty\-two (42) Axis ships. Even more impressive was the fact that the Navy successfully escorted over 25,000 convoy crossings, delivery nearly 182,000,000 tons worth of men and materials critical for the war effort from North America to the United Kingdom. Tragically, this did come at the cost of twenty\-four (24) vessels and nearly 2,000 personnel. By the end of World War II, the RCN had transformed from an inexperienced service to a formidable force; it was the third\-largest navy in the entire world, despite consisting predominantly of destroyers. None could question the diligence displayed by the personnel of the RCN; years of submarine hunting had shaped the service into masters of anti\-submarine warfare. That experience would come in handy during the Cold War while tracking the Soviet submarines. To this day, the proud traditions of the RCN adhere to the prestige forged by their founders and predecessors. </string>
    <string name="cmw_infoca">With the vast majority of its population spread along the long coastlines of the country, Australia relied upon detached units from the Royal Navy to provide naval defense for more than a century. This arrangement remained the status quo until 1909, when talks began of a dedicated naval unit to be deployed to Australian waters. It was decided between the British Admiralty and the Australian Government that Australia would purchase a "fleet unit" consisting of six destroyers, three cruisers, three submarines, various auxiliaries, and a battlecruiser. The first two ships, HMAS Yarra and HMAS Parramatta, reached Australian waters in November 1910, and on 10 July 1911 King George V granted the title of Royal Australian Navy (RAN) to the Commonwealth Naval Forces. By 1913, the completed Australian fleet — led by battlecruiser HMAS Australia — entered Sydney Harbour for the first time. The RAN served on the frontlines of World War I, supporting Australian landings in the invasion of the German New Guinea colonies and attacking the Ottoman Navy in the Sea of Marmora during the Gallipoli campaign. HMAS Sydney faced off alone against SMS Emden in the middle of the Indian Ocean and won — earning the RAN\'s first victory at sea — while HMAS Australia was later involved in the Battle of Jutland. After the war, the RAN — like most other navies around the world — was forced to make changes as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. They had to scrap their only battlecruiser as a result of the treaty, but gained several pre\-war submarines and destroyers. During the inter\-war period, older ships were sold for scrap while newer heavy cruisers, light cruisers, submarines, destroyers, and a seaplane carrier found their way into RAN service. Hampered by the inter\-war disarmament policies due to shifting economic and political situations, the RAN rose once again to fight in World War II. Throughout 1940, the RAN distinguished itself in the Mediterranean with the famous destroyers of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla". RAN units returned to defend the Australian homeland when war broke out in the Pacific and enemy ships prowled Australian waters, fighting against the encroaching Empire of Japan as close to home as the Coral Sea. Since the end of the Second World War, the Royal Australian Navy has served in operations from the Korean Theater to East Timor, focusing on protecting Australia’s interests in the southwestern Pacific region and peacekeeping around the globe with a 50\-strong fleet of modern destroyers, frigates, submarines, and auxiliaries.</string>

    <string name="frc_desc">"Honor, Homeland, Valor, Discipline." These are still the four tenets that define the Marine Nationale — or "La Royale" — as one of the world\'s oldest navies. The Marine Nationale was instrumental in establishing the French colonial empire and engaging in near\-constant conflicts with their European neighbors, particularly the Royal Navy. Despite constantly being dwarfed in overall size by their closest rival, the well\-funded and well\-equipped Marine Nationale still had an outsized influence on world events and naval strategy, being deeply involved in the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century, the modernizing efforts of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 19th century, negotiating the various post\-World War I naval treaties early in the 20th century, and developing the Jeune École naval theory. Its engineers and shipbuilders were among the best in the world, building the Le Fantasque class of destroyers — the world\'s fastest to this day — and while the French paid little heed to naval aviation, their focus on battleships, especially fast battleships, produced the Dunkerque and Richelieu classes, regarded as among the most successful designs built under the displacement limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely spared from the deep military budget cuts brought about by the Treaty of Versailles during the interwar period, the Marine Nationale took part in the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Weserübung, and Operation Dynamo at the onset of the Second World War. However, the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany meant that all operations with the Allies had to be suspended under the new Vichy France client state, with the exception of those who were able to join the Free French Naval Forces. While the terms of the Armistice meant that France was officially neutral, the British did not want to risk having the most powerful vessels of the Marine Nationale fall into enemy hands. Thus, the Royal Navy was directed to execute Operation Catapult, an attack on the French naval forces docked at Mers\-el\-Kébir, Algeria, on 3 July 1940, greatly souring relations between the two powers for years to come. Nevertheless, rather than allow them to be captured by the Germans as part of Case Anton, French sailors scuttled the remainder of their fleet in Toulon on 27 November 1942, retaining their honor till the very end.</string>

    <string name="frc_infodd">French destroyers have powerful guns and great speed, but without the Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line\-of\-sight for both enemies and teammates.) consumable. \nTo compensate for the lack of smoke, they have an unusual distribution of HP of the hull. Unlike conventional hulls, a part of the ship\'s HP can be reduced to zero and not take damage in those areas. This makes them more durable under fire. \nFrench Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship\'s speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable allow these ships to reach high velocities, making it harder to target.\nStarting from Tier VI, you have access to the Main Battery Reload Booster (When used, main battery reload time is significantly reduced.) consumable. This will be used most efficiently when finishing off enemy destroyers or other low health targets. \nStarting from Tier VIII, French destroyers boast great AP shells with a fast and flat trajectory. These shells will allow the destroyer to penetrate citadels of lightly armoured cruisers at medium ranges. \nFrench destroyers generally don\'t have the best concealment, nor a long torpedo range. It is quite similar to the USSR destroyer line and performs best as a gun boat. Don\'t contest caps too early as you will be spotted first and focused down. Go around the edge of the cap to spot enemy cruisers and BBs for your team. Keep shooting at targets, blazing them on fire with those 139mm guns. The fast speed will allow you to get out of tough situations ASAP. If the enemy dd is spotted, turn on your Main Battery Reload Booster (When used, main battery reload time is significantly reduced.) and wipe them out. As the French destroyers use 139mm HE rounds, they are surprisingly powerful. </string>
    <string name="frc_infoca">French cruisers are very fast, enabling them to fulfill a variety of roles. They are capable of being effective destroyer hunters and cruiser killers. These cruisers are excellent fire\-starters, benefitting from a high fire chance. This can be used to great effect against battleships. However, it is important to be careful because with the exception of the Tier II ship, Jurien de la Gravière, French cruisers below Tier VII are not well\-armored. At lower tiers, it is important to preserve health and avoid extended gunfights with other cruisers and battleships. At Tier V, Émile Bertin has access to the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable; torpedo range is also improved to 9 kilometers, which remains the same throughout subsequent tiers. At Tier VI, La Galissonnière and premium ship De Grasse are the first cruisers that have access to an upgraded version of the Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship\'s speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable. While active, the ship\'s speed is increased by 15\-20%. All French cruisers that are Tier VI and above can mount the standard or premium version of this consumable. At Tier VI, these cruisers also gain access to the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti\-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable, which can be mounted by replacing Hydroacoustic Search. The anti\-aircraft armaments of French cruisers are sub\-optimal, so the use of Defensive AA Fire should be timed well to ensure that enemy aircraft squadrons cannot drop bombs and torpedoes accurately. Boasting up to 110 millimeters of armor at Tier VII, Algérie is the first of the French heavy cruisers. With the addition of armor, these higher tier French cruisers are able to take a hit; however, the armor should not be relied on. Proper positioning, evasive maneuvers, and use of cover are tactics that will ensure the survival of French cruisers throughout a match. At Tier X, players can look forward to Henri IV. This cruiser is a formidable opponent. With the Engine Boost consumable active, Henri IV can reach 43.9 knots, which is faster than most destroyers! Henri IV is a heavy hitter, sporting 240 millimeter main guns with a 12.3 second reload time. These guns have good shell arcs and velocities, allowing for long range accuracy up to the maximum range of 19.08 kilometers. If needed, Henri IV is capable of restoring health with access to the Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship\'s hit points each second.) consumable. </string>
    <string name="frc_infobb">Added in Update 0.7.2, French battleships start at low tier with traditional dreadnought\-style designs, but shift to designs more akin to battlecruisers at higher tiers. They are very fast for their size, and from Tier VIII onward they get access to the Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship\'s speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable, further adding to their speed. Starting from Tier VI, they typically arrange their main battery guns in quadruple turrets, giving them a large volume of fire that is quite accurate and has good characteristics, though the guns themselves tend to be smaller in caliber. Their secondary guns are nothing to sneeze at either, matching or even exceeding the secondaries of those found on Japanese battleships (though still inferior to those of the Germans) and their anti\-air capabilities are above\-par once you get to Tier VII (though they have weak anti\-air prior to that point). Unfortunately, French battleships also stick out like a sore thumb, having absolutely horrid detection values that let enemies see them coming for miles. They also tend to have sub\-par armor when compared to the battleships of other nations, making it easy for their counterparts to land full damage penetrations or citadel hits. Additionally, their anti\-aircraft and secondary batteries tend to be quite fragile; sustained enemy fire from high explosive shells can quickly wreck their defenses. At Tier X, players can look forward to République. This battleship boasts unrivaled speed in its class when making use of her Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship\'s speed by a fixed percentage.), has very accurate main guns that have a better rate of fire than its counterparts, excellent anti\-air capabilities, and strong secondaries with excellent reach. </string>

    <string name="ity_desc">With the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Italian peninsula would not be united for over a thousand years until the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Out of this unification was born the Italian Royal Navy, known as the Regia Marina. Situated in the very center of the Mediterranean, the newly established Regia Marina attempted to claim the Mediterranean Sea as Mare Nostrum (literally "Our Sea"), constantly vying for supremacy against France, England, and Austria\-Hungary, keeping the Regia Marina at the forefront of Italian politics. Unfortunately, they were hampered from the very beginning by a serious lack of cohesion and uniformity in their officers and equipment, pitiful naval budgets resulting in poor infrastructure and facilities with which to support the navy, and rapidly advancing technologies that the divided naval schools of Italy couldn’t keep up with. The navies of Austria\-Hungary and Italy eventually spent most of World War I keeping each other at bay in their respective harbors, with the notable exceptions of the latter\'s MAS motorboats (mezzi d\'assalto, or torpedo armed motorboats) and the first working prototypes of miniature single\-torpedo armed submarines — dubbed "human torpedoes" — employed to sink two Austro\-Hungarian battleships late in the War. \nDuring the interwar period, the Regia Marina was once again pressured by the changing global political situation to choose a proper design doctrine for their warships. Concluding that the French would be their most likely adversaries, they emphasized speed and long\-range gunnery, and set about modernizing their older World War I dreadnoughts, building the Littorio\-class battleships and a wide variety of destroyers, submarines and cruisers, including the Zara\-class: the best\-protected heavy cruisers ever built until they were surpassed almost 20 years later by the U.S. Navy\'s Des Moines class. Entering World War II with the fourth largest navy in the world, the Regia Marina nevertheless struggled against the French and British navies for dominance over the Mediterranean. While having long gun ranges and excellent fire control systems, a near total disregard for radar and sonar technology consigned the Regia Marina to a “fair weather fleet”, relying on visual sighting of targets and making overcast days and night battles incredibly disadvantageous. Greatly aware of their inability to replace losses, naval commanders were forced to confer with headquarters for virtually any engagement, wasting precious time and failing to press even the clearest of decisive advantages. Reasoning that they would only operate in the Mediterranean Sea near the Italian Peninsula, no resources were allocated to the development of naval aviation. Despite this, the Regia Marina had a reputation for having well\-designed ships and well\-trained seamen, showing their defiance after the Battle of Taranto by heavily damaging the battleships HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Valiant, and fighting on against the Royal Navy — a highly experienced foe with overwhelmingly superior numerical and technological advantage — doggedly holding onto the Mediterranean for three long years until the Armistice of 1943. As World War II in Europe drew to a close nearly two years later in May 1945, the surviving units of the Regia Marina were scattered; sequestered or interned in various Allied ports in various states of repair. \nThe birth of the Republic of Italy in June 1946 saw the Regia Marina re\-title itself as the Marina Militare (Military Navy); the following year, Italy was forced to divest nearly all of her surviving naval forces as part of the formal peace process with the victors of World War II. The threat of the Soviet Union, though, quickly pushed the western European powers and the United States into ensuring that Italy had the tools and ability to defend herself, particularly after the new republic became one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. As a part of the new alliance, the primary concern of the Marina Militare became littoral control of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. Today, the Italian Navy operates modern vessels of nearly every type, from aircraft carriers Cavour and Giuseppe Garibaldi all the way down to diesel\-powered attack submarines and coastal patrol boats.</string>
